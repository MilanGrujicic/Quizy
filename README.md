## Game Structure
Quizy is iniatially structured in three phases:

- ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡® Slovenia and its regions;

Each phase displays a map and an input window where the user has to insert the name of the states/regions/provinces. The game checks if the user input matches with a state/region/province name and add to it in the map.
